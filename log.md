Log with activities and questions arising during every week

May 25- May 26
## Activities
* Installed in CTS 5
* Read cs231n Stanford Convnet course (cs231n.github.io).

## To do
* End writing Backgorund
	** ConvNet
	** ConvNet for Breast Cancer
	** Practical Deep Learning
	** Database specifics
* Update LaTex template to thesis template
* Choose software (probably Caffe)
* Select which forms of preprocessing to try

## Questions
* Should I preserve a test set just for the final step (in December) or is it ok to use all data for the preprocessing choosing and then all data for the small vs big and all that?. 
* Is it a binary classification(cancer/no cancer) or 3 classes (micro/mass/nothing) or something else(detection)?
* Validation vs 5-fold crossvalidation?
* When checking for different preprocessings, fit all hyperparameters or only a subset or none at all?
* mxn o nxd for the name of dimensions?  I like mxn.
* Will I have trouble if I use the same data to train and test different models (even if changing randomly the test samples)?
