\section{Experiment}
%Choose what is this experiment: The network could be slided across an image. Options: (1) a network for detection of microcalcification and one for masses (and slide both across and plot their results with differerent colors) (2) a network for diagnosis of microcalc and one for masses(slide them both) and (3) one that detects micro+mass vs non-lession (stanford guys did bad with this one) and (4) one that detects any lession(micro+mass+other) vs no lession and (5) one that also detects more than one network but has multiple output.
