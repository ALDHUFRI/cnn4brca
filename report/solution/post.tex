None, but using CRFs could yield better results.

Say that the logits out of the network were transformed intoprobabilities via softmax
Probabilities vs UNcorrected threshold vs Threshold and cluster extent correction vs threshold-free cluster enhancement vs, show different results at different thresholds
data is smooth, 

uncorrected threshold
Present the probabilities of tumor on each pixel. anmd threshold it on a given prob nd delete any clusters less than x.
Threshold free cluster enhancement (see module 29 in introduction to fmri)
Choose a threshold and delete any clusters less than x...

we could also present a heatmap with the different probabilities in each pixel of the image, for instance on mammograms we could present a grayscale image of whether a lesion is present.

% CRFs: public available implementation of (Krahenbuhl & Koltun)
% For the figure draw a random one  of 100x100 with a little signal in there and apply all corrections.

% Python implementation of CRF: https://pystruct.github.io/auto_examples/image_segmentation.html

% If using the threshold/ value under the cluster one, use the validation set t select pairs(threshold, total acceptable value)

% Background is thresholded at zero and shown in black

% Background is not counted to calculate the metrics. We use a mask to sum values only over the spaces that were a breast mass previously.
