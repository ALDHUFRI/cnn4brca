The main goal of this work is to succesfully apply convolutional networks to segment breast cancer lesions in digital mammograms and to compare our results with those obtained by other groups doing similar work.
Particularly, there are various subgoals which we expect to achieve as the project advances:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Obtain and process the mammographic database to make it available for future research on campus.
	\item Develop software tools to handle the database and train new deep learning models.
	\item Analyze the performance of convolutional networks reported on the literature.
	\item Train a modern, fine-tuned convolutional network to perform lesion segmentation.
	\item Show the viability of convolutional networks for breast cancer detection and diagnosis.
	\item Generate results that could produce a conference or journal article.
	\item Use an alternative convolutional network model to improve our results.
	\item Propose new ideas for future research in the topic.
\end{itemize}
