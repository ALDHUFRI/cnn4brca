% Cancer affects this many people. One signal of cancer in mmamograms does that and that.
% In this thesis, we detect these signs using convolutional networks, machine learning models designed specially for 2-d data.
% We test different preprocessing configurations and network architectures.
% Results and conclusion.


%Breast cancer background
%Convolutional networks ar emodern machine learning model who can perform image segmentation as a single end-to-end learnable model
%We wanted to show that convolutional networks can be used for image segmentation of breast cancer lesions. 
%We did, with average results
%We showed that convolutional networks are a promising avenue of research/candidate
