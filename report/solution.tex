% We [outline|describe|introduce] our [proposed] [solution|model], [justify] design decisions and [implementation details| detail implementation| document implementation details].
In this chapter, we describe our experiments, justify design decisions and detail our implementation.

\section{Task definition}
We segment digital mammograms into two separate regions: breast mass (benign or malignant) and general tissue.
Breast area is previously separated from the background by simple thresholding.
In particular, we train a convolutional network to estimate the probability of each pixel belonging to a mass and use these predictions to generate a valid segmentation.

\section{Summary}
In this chapter, we provide a thorough description of our experiments and the parameters used for each experiment. Database was preprocessed using that and thata. Experiment 1 does that and that, Experiment 2 does that and that. We hope the description is detailed enough to allow for replication of results
