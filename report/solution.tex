% We [outline|describe|introduce] our [proposed] [solution|model], [justify] design decisions and [implementation details| detail implementation| document implementation details].
In this chapter, we describe our experiments, justify design decisions and detail our implementation.
% we present a description of tehe experiments ordered chronologically


% An scheme of the solution is found there and we do it here...

\section{Task definition}
We segment digital mammograms into two separate regions: breast mass (benign or malignant) and general tissue.
Breast area is previously separated from the background by simple thresholding.
In particular, we train a convolutional network to estimate the probability of each pixel belonging to a mass and use these values to generate a valid segmentation.
%The breast area is separated from the background by simple thresholding.
%Background and breast area are separated using thresholded to zero.

\section{Experiment 2}
Armed with the unsatisfactory results of Experiment 1 ( see Section. ), we performed our change....
Similar to experiment 1 but with modified loss function.

\section{Experiment 3}
A second architecture modelled on the ResNet~\cite{}, winner of the 2015 ImageNet competition is also used for experiments (Tab~\cite{}).
