\section{Task definition}
We segment digital mammograms into two separate regions: breast mass (benign or malignant) and general tissue.
Breast area is previously separated from the background by simple thresholding.
In particular, we train a convolutional network to estimate the probability of each pixel belonging to a mass and use these predictions to generate a valid segmentation.

\section{Experiment 3}
\label{sec:Experiment3}
We use a different netwrok architecture and insights gained from previous experiments to improve our results. 

\subsection{Architecture}
An architecture modelled on the ResNet~\cite{}, winner of the 2015 ImageNet competition is also used for experiments (Tab~\cite{}).
