	\subsection{Database I}
There are many publicly available mammography databases and many more which are private. Given the size of the expected network architecture and the data thirst of convolutional networks we focus only on the bigger databases. We also need pixel-level labels, i.e., lesions to be marked on each mammogram; this is generally made by expert radiologists drawing the boundaries of the lessions in the mammograms.
% Do I need to have perfect image segmentation?. Maybe not.
Furthermore, we prefer to have good contrast resolution, the number of gray colors represented per pixel, and good spatial resolution, the area represented per pixel: at least 12-bit images ($10^12 = 4048$ gray values per pixel) with 0.1-0.15 mm maximum pixel size. Greater constrast resolution means that more brightness values are captured per pixel while greater spatial resolution means that hopefully more detail is included in the image. Most mammography databases including all described below satisfy these conditions.

	The Breast Cancer Digital Repository (BCDR-DM) consists of 3.6K digital mammograms from 724 patients; this number was obtained from its website (\url{bcdr.eu/information/about}) which also states the database is still in construction and it is expected to have mammograms from 2000 to 3000 patients. Mammograms are 14-bit images with good spatial resolution~\footnote{The webpage does not explicitly states the image's spatial resolution but judging by the size of the entire images it is good enough.}. Each lesion outline is marked in the image along with its assesment and other relevant clinical data. They also have a fairly big repository of digitised film mammograms called BCDR-FM (3.7K) but at lower resolutions.
% Only has 270 patients(various studies), total 1K images, segmentations are found on image but no acces tfiles. Frick. Ask em for the other maybe.

We have decided to use digital over film mammograms. Digital mammograms are sharper and do not have marks, stamps or other artifacts present in digitised film mammograms. On the downside, because the technology is newer it may be harder to obtain big databases and given its higher resolution they are normally heavier in terms of disk space. We believe the network will be able to pick up better features from the higher quality images and that the size on disk will not be a trouble given the storage availability on current computers. A small number of examples in the database is a big problem and some alternatives are offered below in case the network is not able to learn with the available data. For these reasons, we have decided to use initially the BCDR-DM and INbreast databases.
%A small desciption is offered below.

%	\subsubsection{BCDR-DM}
%	Yet to write
% Files and how are they organized. Data available per case and per mammogram. How are boundaries written. formats, etc.
% 159 calcifications, 36 micro, 11 micro+calcif, thus 108 micro or calcif. 106 nodule, 20 nodule+ calcific, 11 nodule + micro
	
	\subsection{Image retrieval/Preprocessing}
	\input{model/imageRetrieval} 
% Images will not be zero-centered , normalized or whitened. global contrast
% with global contrast stretching will make comparisons across patients not good, because if a pixel is very bright in one patient that is only important with respect to that patient and it may end up (by contrast stretching) having the same value that the pixel in another mammogram who wasn't as bright but was the brightest of the mammogram. i think this makes sense because masss are going ot be bright but only in relation to the patient, maybe one has very fatty tissue so all is white and others have very clear tissue.
% Labels are background, lession and breast tissue. 
	
	\subsection{Data augmentation}
	Rotations and flipping of original big images


	\subsection{Data division}
	70/15/15 is a good split. stratified per patient, this total number of patients in each set and this total number of mammograms (after augmentation) and this total number of lesions.
