	\section{Operationalization}
	We document here how we tranform/reduce the breast cancer detection and diagnosis task into a machine learning task able to be taken by convolutional networks, i.e., how we produce a data set with $m$ inputs $x^{(i)} \in \mathbb{R}^n$ and $m$ corresponding labels $y^{(i)}$. We use this notation throughout this section.

	Training deep neural networks is computationally intensive and requires equipment with powerful GPUs. We enlist here the resources available for this thesis.

	\subsection{Architecture}
	Using the advice in Section~\ref{subsec:PracticalDL} we decided to use a simple network with six convolutional layers and two fully connected layers with the following architecture:

		\caption[Selected Convolutional Network Architecture]{Architecture of the network used for experiments. It shows the filter, stride and padding used in each layer as well as the resulting volume and the number of learnable parameters per layer.}
	\end{table}

	The first convolutional layer uses a $5 \times 5$ filter with stride 2 (padding 2) to reduce the input spatial size from $127 \times 127$ to $64 \times 64$. After that all filters are $3 \times 3$ with stride 1 (padding 1), which preserves the spatial size and the pooling is $2\times 2$ stride 2 (padding 0) which reduces the spatial size by a half. This architecture has 4.63 million learnable parameters. 

	In case the input was size $64 \times 64$ pixels we could replace use a $3 \times 3$ filter with stride 1 in the first convolutional layer and leave everything else unchanged. For an all convolutional architecture we could replace all pooling layers by a $5 \times 5$ filter  with stride 2 and use input images of size of $113 \times 113$ or $129 \times 129$.

	\subsection{Evaluation}
	When dividing the data set we make sure \textit{all} image patches obtained from the same patient are assigned to either the training set or test set (not distributed) to avoid any possible overfit to the test set. Given that our data is unbalanced, with far more negative than positive examples, we use PRAUC (see Section~\ref{subsec:Classification}) to choose between models for hyperparameter selection and as an overall performance metric. Other metrics are also reported for completeness. 

	We could also evaluate the network on all augmentations of an image and output the average prediction; in theory, this would give us better results. For simplicity, we do not apply it for model selection.

	For detection of lesions on entire mammograms we slide the trained convolutional network across the mammogram computing a per-pixel prediction. The generated heatmap preserves the size of the original mammogram (with some zero-padding) and can be presented side to side to the original mammogram as a CAD system. In case this heatmap is noisy (predictions changes abruptly from pixel to pixel) we could use a median or gaussian filter to smooth it out.% We do not evaluate the network on the entire mammogram (or per patient), we limit ourselves to show the results.

	\subsection{Software}
	We use Caffe~\cite{Jia2014} to train the networks and Python to develop any other tools (image retrieval and augmentation, model evaluation, figure generation, etc.).





	\part{Experiments}
	\section{Experiment 1: detection vs diagnosis masses or microcalcifications.}
%Choose what is this experiment: The network could be slided across an image. Options: (1) a network for detection of microcalcification and one for masses (and slide both across and plot their results with differerent colors) (2) a network for diagnosis of microcalc and one for masses(slide them both) and (3) one that detects micro+mass vs non-lession (stanford guys did bad with this one) and (4) one that detects any lession(micro+mass+other) vs no lession and (5) one that also detects more than one network but has multiple output. 
	Task selected. Architecture selected. Hyperparameters selected. results and discussion.
