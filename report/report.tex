	\section{Operationalization}
	We document here how we tranform/reduce the breast cancer detection and diagnosis task into a machine learning task able to be taken by the convolutional networks, i.e., how we produce a data set with $m$ inputs $x^{(i)} \in \mathbb{R}^n$ and $m$ corresponding labels $y^{(i)}$. We use this notation throughout this section.

	\subsection{Convolutional network}
	The network could be slided across an image. Options: (1) a network for detection of microcalcification and one for masses (and slide both across and plot their results with differerent colors) (2) a network for diagnosis of microcalc and one for masses(slide them both) and (3) one that detects micro+mass vs non-lession (stanford guys did bad with this one) and (4) one that detects any lession(micro+mass+other) vs no lession and (5) one that also detects more than one network but has multiple output.
	
	Questions: how to deal with corners of images when presenting results, maybe not that important. Try extreme padding or just leaving it there.

	Questions: Should I only use images from digital mammograms. Is there enough. Or maybe only use digital for testing (train on the ones who are harder: digitized and test on digital only).

	Questions: If i choose to go with simple networks, start with microcalcifications or masses. which one is more useful (apparently masses).
