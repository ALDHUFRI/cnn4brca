Here I document each decision taken and its possible alternatives. The first one is the one I took, the others are ordered according to what I believe would be the next best.

-- Data set
Lesions
	Masses
	Calcifications and microcalcifications
Mammograms
	Digital from BCDR
	Film from DDSM
Division
	70% training, 15% val, 15% test
	70% training, 10% val, 20% test
Cropping
	Cropping to breast area to not have lots of black space (smaller images)
	No cropping
Enhancement
	Global background reduction + contrast stretching
	Global contrast stretching/No enhancement	
	Local contrast stretching
	local background reduction + contrast
Receptive field(size in cms and pixels)
	2cm in 112x112 pixels
	2cm in 96x96
Downsampling interpolation (images and labels)
	LANCZOS filter from PILLOW
	BICUBIC filter form PILLOW
Augmentation
	Flipped and rotations 0,90,180,270 (8). Test set not augmented
	Flipped and rotations 0,180 (4). Test set not augmented
Storage
	Store all augmented images and its augmented labels
	Store originals and sample an image and a data augmentation for every
		training batch

--Model
ConvNet architecture
	The one starting at 112 (2.8M parameters) (arch #11)
	The one starting at 96 (1.6M parameters) (arch #12)
	The one starting at 128 (4.6M params) (arch #8)

--Training
Local zero-mean center each image
	Before training
	Leave as is
Activation function

	ReLu
Update Rule
	Adam
	NAG
Pooling
	Overlapping Max-Pooling
	Convolutional overlapping pooling
	Non-overlapping max-pooling
First layer Conv-Pooling
	6x6 filter stride 2 padding 2
	4x4 filter stride 2 padding 1
Batch size
	One entire image per batch
	As many as memory supports
Regularization
	Dropout + BatchNorm + Regularization
Software
	Tensorflow
	Caffe
Learning rate
	Biggest not divergent and halve when converged
