1. Manual examination to delete people with implants or things like that.
2. Format computer-install TensorFlow. Maybe just install TensorFlow.
3. Find what kind of file does caffe/tensorflow receives.
2. Learn what is the way that i want the input as (big whole images, a lot of small images, numpy matrices)
2. Find a way to reorganize and rename each file (or decide to left as is). Maybe mix all patients and join the outlines.
	2.1 Separate test and training (in turn separate cv here)
	2.2 Connect the positions which are open (thowing a stright line between them) or maybe with a heatmap (maybe this is easier on a per pixel training).
4. Take some other decisions on tretrieval, to make easy to generate the heatma later.
