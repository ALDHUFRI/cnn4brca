Preprocessing(http://scipy-lectures.github.io/advanced/image_processing/#statistical-information)
	contrast in python seems good.
	median if noisy
	wavelet, not tried
	(other enhancements)


% Train a simple convolutional
% Train one with bells and whistles(choosen by heart)
% Choose better hyperparameters
% Unbalanced datasets
% For final model, use both(only convolutions and conv&pool)
% Use VGG Net pretrained in Caffe.
% Train an ensemble of networks with different hyperparameters at the start and average.

% IN methodology write a section called operationalization were i explain how the problem is reduced to a clsssification task(what are the labels and how the images are cropped and what are the performance metrics))
