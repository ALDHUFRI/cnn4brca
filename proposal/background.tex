Convolutional networks 
%sparse with not all possible connections of within  a layer being present.

Feedforward networks (left) initially proposed as two-layer perceptrons (Rosenblatt, 1958) and later developed into “deep” networks (e.g., Hinton et al., 2006 and LeCun et al., 1998). 
Convolutional networks, also known as ConvNets or CNNs, were first introduced by Fukushima et al. ) yuneetr the name of neocognitron, =sskks and later refined and exapnded by LeCun)=. The first convolutional networks, called neocognitron (from neocortex and pereptron) are a natural expansion of simple Artificial Neural  Networks inspied on the way our neocortex process visual information.
Convolutional networks are formed by subsequent layers of units and 
Each neuron does that and that, actrivation function, figure. this neurons were used on  this and this. Feature maps act as feature detcetors on the image


Lecun workes on this and this,.. adding that and that and showing its applicability in that and that. 
More recently, various advances have been fostered by the interest on deep learning and more computational power as... dropout, ReLus, ...

GPU gains and recent advances have nmad econvnets one of the leading options for o ject recognition tasks in visual image recognition as imageNet, ...
They have replaced standard methods that require handcrafted feature selection on various subjects

although, convnets were inspired on neocortex they ghave bracehd out of this initially simple convolutional netowkrs and become veruy different in aras of finding improvemest over tye classification and without regard of the biology behiund oit.thus, they do not represent a valid model of the ewya the human braoin processes visual information. Reagardless of that, some davances in neuronscience still inspire new advancement s in convnets and some of the onvnets results ahave shown some results in neuroscience to be true (cite...)

Training on backpropagation,

side note on language
I will sometimes refer to convolutional netowkrs with no pooling or maxout layers as simple convolutional networks and to those developed more recently simply as convolutional networks. i would also put the parameters of each onvnet to avoid any confusion
