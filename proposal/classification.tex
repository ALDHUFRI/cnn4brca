Classification is a part of Machine learning . A \emph clasfier} takes as ainput a vector of \emph{Features} describirng the problem and priduces an ouptut defining to shic class the output belongs to. Normally classifcation is donde in binary and when using multiclass more than one is used.

Measuring a classifier
An unbalanced classification task is  a proble,m that has only a small number of examples of either one of the classes, in this case we have to deal with learning a classfiication function (via a classifer such as ConvNets) when presented with an unbalanced dat set and measuring the quality of given classifier. Breats cancer classificaiton, as well as the classificaiton of rarediseases(not common in the population) is an unbalanced classificait0on taks because  from a randomly selected sample of patients only a small number will have breast cancer/ belong to the positive class.
The quality of a classifer trained in a balanced class is usually measured using the accuracy on an independent test set, i.e. the proportion of correct classifications it maskes on the test set. nonetheles, for unbalanced classesth is is not a good measure for unbalanced classes as those some bad classifiers can achieve very good accuracy, for instance a classifier that predicts that a patient does not have breast cancer will be correct around x% of the time but it is clearly not a good predictor for our problem. 
FOr unblanced classes a set of metrics calculated in base of its confusion matrix is used. A confusion matrix is this>

and some of the most used classifiers are 
Sensitivity used in mediciine
Specificity or Recall used in medicine
Precision
F1-score
AUC
We will generally present the results of specificity, Sensitivity and F1-score and use them to measure the perfomrance of our classifiers.
