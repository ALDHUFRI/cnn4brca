\begin{abstract}
Breast cancer is one of the most common and deadly cancers in woman around the world. The best tools used today for early breast cancer diagnosis are screening mammograms; mammograms are x-ray pictures of the breast used by radiologists to identify microcalcifications and breast masses, signs of early breast cancer development. Traditional computer systems use handmade features and complex image techniques to detect these lesions in mammographic images. In this work, we plan to use convolutional networks, a recent development in computer vision, which can automatically learn the important features for the classification task given enough training data. Convolutional networks have been used in some studies for breast cancer detection but we hope to introduce newer features and carefully tune the architecture to produce improved results. In addition, this will be the first approximation to use deep learning techniques as part of an ongoing project in the institution which aims to develop a computer-aided diagnosis system for breast cancer. This thesis proposal is presented for approval to obtain the degree of Master of Science in Intelligent Systems.

We offer an introduction to some of the essential concepts needed to understand the rest of this document. We start by discussing breast cancer and mammograms in Section~\ref{subsec:BreastCancer}, we describe the specifics of the mammography database used for this thesis in Section~\ref{subsec:MammographyDB}, we offer some basic concepts about classification and evaluation measures in Section~\ref{subsec:Classification}, in Sections~\ref{subsec:ANNs} and~\ref{subsec:ConvNets} we give a short introduction into Artificial Neural Networks and Convolutional Neural Networks and finally we offer an overview of how convolutional networks have been used for breast cancer diagnosis in Sections~\ref{subsec:BreastCancerConvNets} and~\ref{subsec:RelatedWork}.
