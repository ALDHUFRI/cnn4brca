Signs
	Microcalcifications
	Masses
In this work we will center on using mammogrmas (2d Xray images of the breast) to detect microcalcifications and masses and diagnos its likelihood of breast cancer, i.e, make a prediction on the probability that a mmaogram signals breast cancer. this is of importance because of ...
